// the var can be anything, but best practice is to use something another coder stepping in will understand
//var playerName = window.prompt("What is your robot's name?");

// Note the lack of quotation marks around playerName
//console.log(playerName);
//console.log("This logs a string, good for leaving yourself a message");
// this will do math and log 20
//console.log(10 + 10);
// what is this?
//console.log("Our robot's name is " + playerName);

// this creates a function named "fight"

//function fight() {
  //  window.alert("The fight has begun!");
//}

// this is to "call" the function / make it do something (above function won't do anything if you don't call it)

//fight();
